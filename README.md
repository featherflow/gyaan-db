1. Install tesseract using brew -- brew install tesseract
2. Have tested on python 3.9 and 3.10, might break for other versions
3. OpenAI API keys with enought monies in it. Though 3.5 is honestly very cheap for personal small scale usage.

$ python main.py --filename [FILENAME] --api_key [OPENAi API KEY]
```
